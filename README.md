# Unity DOTS Character Controller Example

This repository contains the source code for a basic kinematic character controller implemented using Unity DOTS (Data-Orientated Tech Stack) with the new Entities (ECS) and Physics packages.

There is an accompanying article, 

* [**Unity DOTS Character Controller**](https://www.vertexfragment.com/ramblings/unity-dots-character-controller)

which steps through how the controller was created. 

It should be noted that this project is for demonstration purposes only, and there is no guarantees of its correctness. This project _may_ see occasional future updates to support new Unity or package versions and/or bug fixes.

The code was written against:

* Unity v2020.1.3f1
* [Entities v0.14.0-preview.18](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@0.14/manual/index.html)
* [Physics v0.4.1-preview](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@0.4/manual/index.html)
